2- Fully automatic scanning requires Firmata sketch to be uploaded to an Arduino, which then allows Python to comunicated from a browser. 
Detailed description of how to upload sketchs into an Arduino, how to get started with Python as well as the circuit diagram depicting the picture below can be found here: https://www.duckafterduck.com/blog/make-yourself-an-automatic-35mm-scanner

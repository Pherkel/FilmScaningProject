# FilmScaningProject

There are two modes of running this automization: 

1- Mechanized version will only require an Arduino sketch to be uploaded to an Arduino. Corrections and framings for the camera alighnment are made manually using push buttons. 

2- Fully automatic scanning requires Firmata sketch to be uploaded to an Arduino, which then allows the Python program to comunicate with the arduino from within a browser. 

Detailed description of how to upload sketchs into an Arduino, how to get started with Python as well as the circuit diagram depicting in the picture below can be found here: https://www.duckafterduck.com/blog/make-yourself-an-automatic-35mm-scanner
